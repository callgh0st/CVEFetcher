# CVEFetcher: Streamlined CVE Search for Cybersecurity Professionals Aspiring Cybersecurity Enthusiast

As an aspiring cybersecurity professional, I'm passionate about learning and contributing to the field. This tool, CVEFetcher, is a product of my learning journey, inspired by my participation in the TCM: Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course.
Project Vision

CVEFetcher aims to simplify and streamline the CVE search process for cybersecurity professionals. By leveraging the Vulners API, this tool enables users to conveniently search for specific CVEs via the CLI and retrieve essential details, including CVE descriptions and severity ratings. By doing so, CVEFetcher reduces the time and effort required for manual CVE searches through web browsers.
Future Enhancements

The tool's capabilities will continue to evolve, with future enhancements planned for:

    Affected Systems: Provide information about systems affected by the CVE.
    Proof-of-Concept (PoC): Integrate links to relevant PoCs for further analysis.
    Caching Mechanism: Optimize performance and API usage by implementing a caching mechanism.
    Vulnerability Database Integration: Expand exploit coverage by integrating with vulnerability databases.
    Filtering and Sorting: Implement filtering and sorting options for refined exploit search results.
    Graphical User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface for enhanced user experience.

# Tool Functionality

CVEFetcher offers the following functionalities:

    CVE Search: Search for exploits associated with specified CVEs.
    Detailed Exploit Information Retrieval: Retrieve and display detailed exploit information, including:
        Description: A comprehensive explanation of the CVE.
        Severity: A standardized assessment of the exploit's risk level, aiding in prioritizing mitigation efforts.

# Target Users

CVEFetcher is primarily designed for cybersecurity professionals who require quick access to essential exploit details for vulnerability assessment and mitigation purposes.
Benefits

Using CVEFetcher offers several benefits, including:

    Streamlined Exploit Information Retrieval: Access exploit descriptions and severity ratings quickly without the inconvenience of manual online searches.
    Centralized CVE Exploit Details: Gather critical exploit information directly from the Vulners API, ensuring a reliable and up-to-date knowledge base.
    Enhanced Vulnerability Assessment Workflow: Simplify vulnerability assessment tasks by having immediate access to CVE details.

# Setup
